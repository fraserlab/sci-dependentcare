<p>We sent out a survey last Friday to gather information on needs and demographics for caregivers within our research community, including staff, trainees, and faculty. This was advertised through graduate programs and QBI. We received 195 responses by Sunday evening, although the survey will remain open until Wednesday. Below is an initial overview of the current results. We have also included a snippet of the free-form comments to give you a sense of some of the key themes that came through. It is clear that balancing two full-time jobs of both research and caregiving has been a tremendous challenge that is not tenable, if we value research productivity, mental health, and equity. We will update this page after the final tally on Wednesday evening, and those results will be shared with the broader UCSF childcare taskforce and university leadership.</p>

<h3 id="below-are-listed-a-fraction-of-the-short-answer-comments-which-provides-a-window-into-the-experiences-and-concerns-of-your-fellow-colleagues">Below are listed a fraction of the short answer comments, which provides a window into the experiences and concerns of your fellow colleagues:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the survey and concern, but we won’t let anyone new in our home and everything for the kids is virtual. Not sure what you can do. Extensions to deadlines would be nice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe ucsf could have nannies or sitters (already recommended by other collagues) that can be available for last minute meetings or experiments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t know how I will teach with my kids at home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a one month old baby at home. My wife is a postdoc as well so it will be great if UCSF provides help/support for postdocs in order to defray the costs of daycares in SF.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we send our son to bright horizons at mission bay, but don’t feel comfortable sending him back, particularly given the lack of testing and the reported case of a teach testing positive and working with the kids for multiple days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UCSF daycare re-opened at a reduced capacity and we lost our spots, and now public elementary school will be canceled. There are so many difficult tradeoffs to navigate in terms of providing enough social/emotional enrichment and instruction, while ensuring safety, while also needing reliable care to do our jobs well, while also considering the high costs in SF.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flexible childcare options needed to accommodate work from home settings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that nearly all Bay Area schools are going to remote learning, this places enormous strain on those of us in families with 2 full time working parents, even though we have some (but not total) flexibility to work from home from time to time. Given the vast number of families that will need some type of supervision of children at home, there are little to no qualified individuals available (all care websites are oversubscribed)- UCSF will need a definitive plan and financial resources to make us able to work in these conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pacifica school district will be online only in the fall, we desperately need assistance with child care.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like so many, I am in need of childcare while I am working remotely full-time, but safe options are limited if nonexistent due to Covid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be great if there could be a stipend for child care</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that all UCSF staff are getting asked these questions, including food service, cleaning, etc staff members</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could Cole Hall or Toland Hall be big enough for kids (maybe 9-years+) to social distance while distance learning? Ideally, they could get some help or guidance with some work, or at minimum some moral support. Even with social distancing, at least they could get some in-person interaction. Kids are lonely and missing going to school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this is very impotent! without support for our dependents we won’t be able to proceed with our research. thanks for thinking about this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Short term solutions might be needed in case daycare or than preschool shuts down without notice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is HARD. As a PI, not only that I have to keep our science going forward, but the students/postdocs are in extra need of help/support to maintain their work, many have mental health issues dealing with COVID and racial injustice crises, beinf a foreigner in this country at the present times, on top of having zero support to care for my children 24h/7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safty (how do you make sure daycare is safe, last week California reported 998 cases of COVID19 from childcare) and price</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My 15 year old daughter is interested in online tutoring or being a tutor as part of a pod</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure it is possible for the institution to find child care to replace public education, especially given that UCSF community members do not always live in San Francisco. In addition to this, or in parallel, we could ask for non-parents to pick up additional service from parents as a way to offer immediate support, instruction to P&amp;T committees to adjust expectations of parents and all UCSF community members, and direct financial assistance to parents to support child care or administrative roles they deem necessary in their role. Lastly, I ask that we prioritize postdocs and students for child care needs since they are more vulnerable than faculty. Thank you for doing this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was without childcare for almost 3 months, now back to childcare but who knows how long? We need assitance for potential childcare shutdowns again, we need reasonalbe response to how an already experinced lack of childcare is impacting careers, productivity, gender diversity! (it comes down to money: funds for technician support for researchers to compensate for already damaged productivity, funds for additional childcare options (nanny) for future shut downs)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will gathering people in UCSF into small group (5 families per group), parents take turns of offering teaching for the kids. This schooling bubble may help to keep normal life and minimize the pandemic spreading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to come back to work partially even my household already invested 1000’s of USD in hiring private childcare, which is both a neccessity and a HUGE financial burden on a postdoc salary at the bay area. personally my household doesn’t have any more rope and would soon go into debt or would just need to leave academia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe there is a way to organize small group classes - or a list of potential available teacher that might offer their services and UCSF employees in need could sign up?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pandemic affects every family of every age. Stay strong!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My spouse is voluntarily unemployed to take care of our children at home. Daycare is so expensive, that if they went to work, the financial benefit would be negligible for our family.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that my work will suffer if we cannot sort out childcare. As a busy PI my job (and the job of my 15 employees) absolutely depends on me writing grants. I don’t see how that will happen with a kid in my ‘home office’ struggling with online education in the SF public schools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an incoming student, it’s difficult to find childcare, pre-covid, now it feels impossible. We have been working from home, so I have been caring for my son during the day and working at night. I wish there was a way for incoming students to have a trial period at a UCSF childcare facility, like 3 months available while we found childcare elsewhere. Additionally, as a student, I do not make anywhere near the amount that is required to afford childcare at UCSF, even with my spouse’s combined income we barley scratch a livable wage for the city. UCSF should offer a childcare center tuition option for grad students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have our elderly mother-in-law living with us, so we must balance risk of exposure to her with childcare needs. It’s a double-bind without a clear solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some (any) help with childcare is desperately needed.</p>
  </li>
