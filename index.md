## 1) Goal #1: Create website that updates on our efforts (will be done today)

This website will be specific to the research community at UCSF and update on things James and I are up to. We hope to provide news on a regular basis so you are aware of what is going on. We will also post a summary of the survey here, so be on the lookout.

## 2) Goal #2: Relief from work duties this Fall (get people matched by mid-August)

Our next survey will ask for work responsibilities (e.g. teaching relief, mentorship sharing, committee service, cover for leadership roles, technician or editing services for trainees) that need to be covered in light of caregiver duties. We will do our best to activate others without caregiver responsibilities to share some of this burden. Ideas include teaching, pairing labs for joint lab meetings/mentorship, committee service, temporary cover for leadership roles. 

## 3) Goal #3: Match parents with each other to enable shared caregiving (get people matched before August)

We will create a database of parents, grouped based on your children's age group(s) and your geographic location. For this, we need you to fill out the survey going out Wednesday, and we will have this set up by end-of-day Friday. For those interested, we hope to enable you to self-organize into cohorts to share efforts/costs. You may consider doing this in lecture halls or meeting rooms on campus, which we can help you reserve. We note that “expanding your bubble” comes with a safety risk. We will provide guidance on medical and liability waivers through our website currently under construction. Please look out for updates on that.

## 4) Goal #4: Expand surveillance testing to groups organized in #2 (ongoing)

James is in the testing subgroup of the Childcare Taskforce. It has been difficult to establish surveillance testing even within the highly controlled environment of UCSF childcare run by Bright Horizons. Moreover, the purpose of surveillance testing is to stop the spread of infections early, not to provide a sense of security that individuals are not infected. Surveillance testing options will likely have higher false positive and higher false negative rates than current testing options. We will argue for expanding testing to assembled cohorts and transfer lessons learned from the UCSF childcare to our community.

## 5) Goal #5: Find $ support (ongoing)

Our follow-up survey will ask for more info from you on the urgency and amount of $ need. We are actively working with Dan Lowenstein and finance and development offices to ease/clarify restrictions on funds for childcare. We are also trying to activate departments and donors to contribute once we have that figured out. We will prioritize those in most need, with an understanding that trainees are in an extremely tough spot. If you have any leads on potential donors, please let us know.

## 6) Goal #6: Communicate extent of crisis to department heads or PIs (in 2 weeks)

For faculty, we will send your chairs an anonymized summary of the data we collected, both broadly and specific to your department. For trainees and staff, we send an anonymized summary of the data we collected for your relative career stage to your PIs or supervisors and identify a point person/mentor to monitor your needs and advocate on your behalf moving forward. We will reinforce the message that chairs and PIs need to explicitly acknowledge the crisis and its impacts. We will also be calling on them to shore up $ support for your dependent care. We hope to identify individuals who can help write internal letters for merits/promotions for those significantly impacted by this crisis.
