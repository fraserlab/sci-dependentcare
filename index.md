These efforts are being implemented on an evolving ad hoc basis by James and Seemay, in parallel to the work being done by the Child & Dependent Care Taskforce. We are focused specifically on those needs in the basic science research community at UCSF so that we can target unique challenges that are difficult to address at a campus-wide level. Your input is greatly needed to clarify next steps, which are being defined as we go based on your feedback.

### UPDATE, 7/27/20

In response to the second survey, now closed, our next step is to provide connections between families to help organize into “pods” of shared dependent care responsibilities. For respondents who opted-in, we compiled survey results and created Google groups to facilitate introductions between families in the following regions:  Peninsula and South Bay, SF and North Bay, East Bay.   The Google groups provide families with access to a directory (names, contact, ages of kids, caregiving duties needed) to enable sharing of childcare duties.  We will also be providing families with guidance on best practices for forming pods, if they choose to self-organize into groups. We imagine this will be an iterative process that will rely heavily on feedback and success of this first round of matching. We have contracted with an experienced educator to assist with forming groups and answering logistical questions and concerns.  

We will continue to provide updates through this website, so please let us know at any time if you would like to be added to a Google group. In this case, simply send us an e-mail that you are willing to share the following information with UCSF colleagues from your area:  name, email address, affiliation, age group of dependents, work site, dependent care options you are interested in.  If you consent to share this information, you will be added to a Google group and spreadsheet for all families seeking childcare solutions in your region of the Bay Area.  

Our next efforts willl be compiling the results of the surveys for communicating the extent of the crisis to department heads and PIs, and to begin the helping people find relief from work duties this Fall. 

### UPDATE, 7/24/20

- We have put up a new [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/117qs2bLJxoSk4uSOWm2ogz9UEp7l4PAnd77zZcN1UY8/edit) at the side of this web page where you can enter (even anonymously) specifics about how COVID has impacted you (grants, papers, research, leadership positions). This is optional but helpful for us to maintain a growing record of real consequences from this crisis that we will need to pay attention to. Ideally, it would be good to connect this information with demographics, so we can also quantify the impacts on diversity and inclusion.

- In light of the unique needs that students and postdocs have, we are organizing the following:
	- Students: a zoom forum with us tonight (Thurs) at 9pm by [zoom](https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/92380211869?pwd=ckR0Q1k2cC9mWjhJejlYako1TGR1Zz09) and Fri at 9am by [zoom](https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/92530566566?pwd=a2FBZ0l2d2JPQUwvd05DVXZaVWtFZz09). This will allow us to get feedback and establish a direct line of communication for how we can amplify efforts to support them. Anyone is welcome.
	- Postdocs: postdoc Juliane Winkler on the childcare taskforce and assistant professor Ian Seiple will be spearheading a similar effort for postdocs. Stay tuned for updates from Juliane and Ian on how they will help organize. We anticipate a postdocs-specific Zoom forum for this soon. Thank you to Ian for stepping up - we will be in great need of support by others like him who are not battling dependency care issues at this time. If you’d like to help, let us know so that we can have you on our radar to delegate actions to.
	
- Thanks so much to all who have shown interest in personally donating. We are actively trying to figure out how to set up a fund to do this and coordinate this with our data collection such that it can go to those most in need.

- The childcare taskforce met this morning to iron out details regarding the recommendations they will be making to leadership. We shared our approach and some of our results with them there. For brevity, we summarize here some of the key takeaways from that discussion. More details on this will be forthcoming.
	- Survey: there will be a broader survey coming soon, similar to the first one we sent out to the basic science research community, to gather numbers to inform needs/approaches. Please try to fill this out - we understand that there will likely be survey fatigue, but it really does help to communicate the extent of the crisis to leadership and guide decisions.
	- Testing: in addition to clarifying guidelines around symptomatic testing, there will be a push for asymptomatic surveillance testing. This signals a transition from response to prevention, which is key. We conveyed how important this was to allow caregivers the option to participate in solutions, as money is not the only barrier to solving problems - safety is also a chief concern.
	- $$$: there is discussion about providing some $ relief through either reimbursements or stipends. This is highly preliminary as they still need to iron out details in terms of who has greatest need, amount that can be given, and how.
	- Additional resources: it is clear from the committee’s analysis and also our survey that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. We have to provide a diverse menu of options and make things like distributing funds, forming pods, transportation, work relief as easy as possible. 
	- Communication from leadership: it’s clear that there needs to be something soon to acknowledge the extent of the dependency care crisis, and this should come up not just through one message but throughout meetings given that there is little separation between work and home life during this pandemic.
	- NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK: we need all members of our community to pitch in. We all know very well that Science is a team sport. We need to help our teammates as much as possible if we want to come out of this OK. We will be calling on those without caregiving responsibilities to help, so we encourage you to do the same.


### UPDATE, 7/22/10:

We have also posted a summary of the first (now closed) survey [here](/pages/survey.html). **If you are interested in participating in the work relief or caregiving match program, please fill out this [second survey](https://forms.gle/Z6uJP9XYiVPhvSLb6), by Friday, noon.**

### UPDATE, 7/21/10:

We have now received 259 responses to our initial survey, which will close tomorrow (Wed) at noon. Final results from this survey will be updated below afterwards. To keep the momentum going, we are going to go ahead and initiate our follow-up survey so that we can begin processing the data for matching ASAP. We will start by matching families together and then work to try to get caregivers matched up for groups that do not have bandwidth to find caregivers. **If you are interested in participating in the work relief or caregiving match program, please fill out this [second survey](https://forms.gle/Z6uJP9XYiVPhvSLb6), by Friday, noon.**

We will leave the survey open after Friday, so that you may still be added to match groups on a rolling-basis (we will do our best to initiate a new round of matches every Friday) if you change your mind later. If you have any questions, feel free to [e-mail us](mailto:seemayandjames@gmail.com)

The idea that UCSF should prioritize an Equitable Recovery was set down in a [letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hyuL_n6lnId7bi0sOwUi0FYE5cyNfYE41ohybmYY6XQ/edit) delivered to campus leaders on 5/4/2020. This spurred a broader call to arms in the Bay Area in an [op-ed](https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Enabling-economic-and-equitable-recovery-in-the-15293604.php) by several of these faculty and other women in STEM. In response, an initial Equitable Recovery Taskforce was formed at UCSF to advise on next actionable next steps. Since then, several task forces have been launched as UCSF moves to the next phase of COVID-19 operations. [Seemay Chou and James Fraser](mailto:seemayandjames@fraserlab.com) are on the Child & Dependent Care task force that falls within this larger umbrella of efforts. To  help meet the urgent needs of the science research community, which are often distinct from the clinical community, and to update on the progress that the Child & Dependent Care task force is making, we are communicating through this website.


## ~~Goal #1: Create website that updates on the resources available and taskforce actions~~ (completed July 19)

This website will initially be specific to the research community at UCSF and update on the latest developments. We hope to provide news and updated resources on a regular basis so you are aware of what is going on.

We have also posted a summary of the first survey [here](/pages/survey.html).

## Goal #2: Relief from work duties this Fall (get people matched by mid-August)

**A [second survey](https://forms.gle/Z6uJP9XYiVPhvSLb6)**  asks for work responsibilities (e.g. teaching relief, mentorship sharing, committee service, cover for leadership roles, technician or editing services for trainees) that need to be covered in light of caregiver duties. We will do our best to activate others without caregiver responsibilities to share some of this burden. Ideas include teaching, pairing labs for joint lab meetings/mentorship, committee service, temporary cover for leadership roles.

## ~~Goal #3: Match parents with each other to enable shared caregiving~~  (on-going, but see 7/27/20 update above!)

* We are linking parents, grouped based on your children's age group(s) and your geographic location. We hope to enable you to self-organize into cohorts to share efforts/costs. We will start by matching families together. Our next focus will be to try to get caregivers matched up for groups that do not have bandwidth to find caregivers, initially focusing on trainees with needs in this area. ** ***

* We note that “expanding your bubble” comes with a safety risk and good advice for childcare settings is compiled [here](https://cchp.ucsf.edu/). A reference on the effectiveness of liability waivers is [here](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/understanding-liability-waivers-in-the-age-of-covid-19). A sample Risk Acknowledgment form is [here](/assets/pdfs/RISK.pdf) and a sample Waiver is [here](/assets/pdfs/WAIVER.pdf). 

* Existing UCSF resources for finding childcare are listed [here](https://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/familyservices/35/update_child_care_closures_and_alternative_care). 

## Goal #4: Expand surveillance testing to groups organized in #3 (ongoing)

James is in the testing subgroup of the Childcare Taskforce. Surveillance testing has only recently been established within the highly controlled environment of UCSF childcare run by Bright Horizons. While this roll out has been slower than many would like, it is one of the first surveillance testing programs in the city. Moreover, the purpose of surveillance testing is to stop the spread of infections early, not to provide a sense of security that individuals are not infected. Surveillance testing options will likely have higher false positive and higher false negative rates than current testing options. We will argue for expanding testing to assembled cohorts and transfer lessons learned from the UCSF childcare to our community.

## Goal #5: Find $ support (ongoing)

Our follow-up survey will ask for more info from you on the urgency and amount of $ needed. Currently, work by Seemay and James is being generously supported by the [Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics](http://biochemistry.ucsf.edu), [CZ Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org), and [QBI](qbi.ucsf.edu), but we are in need of much more to equitably enable nearly half of our workforce.  We are working directly with Dan Lowenstein and finance and development offices to ease/clarify restrictions on funds for childcare. We are also trying to activate departments and donors to contribute once we have that figured out. Some of you have also asked about donating personally, which we are looking into. We will prioritize those in most need, with an understanding that trainees are in an extremely tough spot. If you have any leads on potential donors, please let us know.

## Goal #6: Communicate extent of crisis to department heads or PIs (in 2 weeks)

For faculty, we will send your chairs an anonymized summary of the data we collected, both broadly and specific to your department. For trainees and staff, we send an anonymized summary of the data we collected for your relative career stage to your PIs or supervisors and identify a point person/mentor to monitor your needs and advocate on your behalf moving forward. We will reinforce the message that chairs and PIs need to explicitly acknowledge the crisis and its impacts. We will also be calling on them to shore up $ support for your dependent care. We hope to identify individuals who can help write internal letters for merits/promotions for those significantly impacted by this crisis.
