### Impacts Survey initial results

Below is a snapshot of some of the COVID-related impacts that our research community is reporting so far (27 responses, and still [collecting responses](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/117qs2bLJxoSk4uSOWm2ogz9UEp7l4PAnd77zZcN1UY8/edit)). For confidentiality, we are editing comments that preserve anonymity. We will update as more results come in.

**A subset of the comments received:**

* Stepped down from 6 leadership roles (5 on campus, 1 off campus) so far. Will continue to step down as the lack of childcare continues.

* I have missed out on major career opportunities that would lead to career advancement due to not having reliable childcare. I have seen my male and non-parent colleagues benefit from these opportunities. The silence and lack of acknowledgement from leadership on this issue is astounding.

* Mixing motherhood with science was already difficult before the pandemic but now I can literally feel that my career is on the line. 

* It's impossible for me to perform experiments in the lab or do data analysis while having to home school and/or provide childcare to my toddler.

* I lost count how often male colleagues told me that their housewife was taking care of things at home but unfortunately I don't have a housewife at home 

* had planned on co-submitting an R01 for an RFA that was PERFECT for me but couldn't even begin writing it
 
* starting a lab, but unable to extend effort to hire people, which will have major consequences on progression.  

* Will affect my hireability for professor positions that I need to apply to this fall. 

* Papers that were supposed to be published in 2020 will be delayed for at least a year

* lost a position due to freeze and kids at home

* Missed the window to apply for two major postdoc fellowships 

* Stuck without funding in a frozen job market.

* I feel that people aren't talking enough about how this has disproportionately affected junior faculty who are pre-tenure. i have zero guidance from any of my more senior colleagues on how to navigate this during covid, and most of the discussion in my department are centrally focused on post-tenure PIs. 

* I have no idea how I'm going to do this job, my mental health is at a breaking point, i have two kids, my salary isn't enough, and all anyone tells me is to make sure i prioritize myself. On the other hand, I get asked for DEI help constantly. 

* I have already missed two grant submissions in the last 4 months.

* I am considering leaving academic science due to reduced income from my husband's position and the amount of lost time I have experienced.

* Productivity reduced by about 50% because of working from home and taking care of two kids

* It's hard to calculate lost opportunities. Some of the things I've turned down or lost include: NIH Study Section, abstract submission for the main professional meeting in my field, active participation in consortia and larger role on collaborative manuscripts/proposals, guest editor for review series in a good journal, service on important committees, unable to commit in advance for graduate program events that might help recruit students to my lab... many, many 'small' professional opportunities that would typically increase visibility of my lab and my work and will add up to professional losses hard to calculate, particularly since I think some of these 'visibility' activities are already impacted by gender bias.

* We had no other care for 3.5 months, having lost our UCSF childcare spot.

* There is 1 grant ($10000-20000) that I was very excited to apply and a great fit for my research interests, but I currently just don`t have the bandwidth to apply; Managing a research study is also difficult (postponed by 2-3 months)-- generally any tasks that require uninterrupted time for thinking and writing. I currently work in 30 min chunks, with multiple interruptions, switching care back and forth with my husband who also works full-time from home. It`s exhausting.
